# React Native FlatList Rendering Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using FlatList in React Native:  an invalid prop `data` type, often leading to unexpected rendering behavior or crashes.  The issue is reproduced and then resolved with improved error handling and data validation. 

## Problem
The original `DataList.js` attempts to render a FlatList before the asynchronous data fetching is complete.  This results in `data` being initially `undefined`, triggering an error.  Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive error handling for the network request itself.

## Solution
The `DataListSolution.js` addresses this by:
1.  **Introducing loading and error states:** These states manage the UI while the data is fetched and handle potential network issues.
2.  **Conditional rendering:** The component only renders the FlatList once the data is loaded successfully.  Appropriate messages are displayed during loading and error states. 
3. **Improved error handling:** Enhanced error handling ensures that any network request failures are caught and displayed to the user.

## How to Reproduce the Error
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`)
4. Observe the initial render, which will likely cause an error.

## How to See the Solution
1. Replace `DataList.js` with `DataListSolution.js`
2. Re-run the app.

The corrected component will now display a loading message until the data is successfully retrieved and gracefully handles network errors.
